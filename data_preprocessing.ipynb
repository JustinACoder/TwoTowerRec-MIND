    "The goal is to take the raw data files and create 3 csv files: user_features.csv, item_features.csv, interactions.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, we have:\n",
    "- `behaviors.tsv`: The click histories and impression logs of users\n",
    "- `news.tsv`: The information of news articles\n",
    "- `entity_embedding.vec`: The embeddings of entities in news extracted from knowledge graph. We might use this later. For now, we will just use the text information in the news articles.\n",
    "- `relation_embedding.vec`: The embeddings of relations between entities extracted from knowledge graph. In our case, we won't be using this file. This is more useful when we want to use graph neural networks over the knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the plan is to first create the item features (since the user features will depend on the item features as we will see later), then create the user features, and finally create the interactions file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Item Features\n",
    "Right now, in `news.tsv` we have the following columns: News ID, Category, SubCategory, Title, Abstract, URL (many have expired by now), Title Entities (entities contained in the title of this news), Abstract Entities (entites contained in the abstract of this news).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we won't try retrieving the content of the news articles using the URLs (or finding them through web search) since that would be too time consuming and is likely not necessary to showcase the benefits of the Two-Tower model. In a real world scenario, it would be ideal to retrieve the full text of the articles to get better representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how we will initially create the item features:\n",
    "- Combine the title and abstract into a single text field then use MiniLM to create text embeddings for each news article\n",
    "- Use the subcategory (not category as well since redundant) as learnable embeddings during model training (better than one-hot encoding since there are many subcategories)\n",
    "- Potential future improvement: Use the weighted average of the entity embeddings (from `entity_embedding.vec`) as another set of features"

    "## User Features\n",
    "In `behaviors.tsv` we have the following columns: Impressions ID, User ID, Time, History (ordered clicked news IDs separated by space), Impressions (the list of news IDs shown to the user with click labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I understand it is that each row corresponds to a single session that starts at <Time> for <User ID>. During this session, the user was shown the list of news articles in <Impressions> and clicked on some of them (indicated by the label 1). The <History> column contains the news articles that the user had clicked on in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "These impressions are those made by randomly selected users during the 5th week of the MIND dataset collection period. The history contains the clicked news articles from the first 4 weeks. This means that a user will have the same history for all impressions in week 5 even if in theory, their history technically evolves each time they read an article in week 5. To stay faithful to the dataset, we will not augment the history with clicks made in week 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how we will create the user features:\n",
    "- **History-based text embeddings with prior**: For each user, we will take the news articles in their history, get the text embeddings from the item features we created earlier, and average them to create a single text embedding representing the user's interests. To avoid issues with users who have very short histories or no histories, we will add a prior embedding which is the average embedding of all news articles in the dataset. This way, even if a user has only clicked on one article, their embedding will still contain some general information about the news domain. The more articles a user has in their history, the less influence the prior embedding will have. The formula is as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{history\\_embedding} = \\frac{\\lambda \\cdot \\text{prior\\_embedding} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{article\\_embedding}_i}{\\lambda + N}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of articles in the user's history.\n",
    "- **History-length ($N$)**: The number of articles in the user's history scaled and normalized. This gives the model a sense of how active the user is. This can also help the model distinguish between users with very short histories and those with long histories but that read articles around the global prior.\n",
    "- That's it (unfortunately we don't have more demographic information about the users in this dataset). Ideally, we would want things such as age, gender, location, reading patterns, etc, etc. However, as with many public datasets, this information is not available due to privacy concerns."

    "## Interactions\n",
    "Here, we actually need to create 2 seperate interaction matrix files, one for each model.\n",
    "### Matrix Factorization model\n",
    "The first thing to note here is that the vanilla MF model doesn't differentiate between negative interactions (items that were shown but not clicked) and unknown interactions (items that were never shown). This is a limitation of the MF model since in reality, we would want to treat these 2 types of interactions differently. There are variations of MF that can handle this [[1]](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf). However, since the goal is to compare the Two-Tower model against the vanilla MF model, we will stick to the basic MF formulation here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing is that there might be multiple impressions for the same user and item pair. For example, a user might have been shown the same article multiple times during the week. It is also possible that the user clicked on the article one time but not the other times. However, for the MF model, we can only have a single interaction value for each user-item pair. To resolve this, we will define the interaction value as the ratio of clicks to impressions for that user-item pair. For example, if a user was shown an article 3 times and clicked on it once, the interaction value will be 1/3 = 0.33. If the user never clicked on it, the interaction value will be 0. If the user always clicked on it, the interaction value will be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, saving the interaction matrix in a dense format (i.e., a full matrix with all user-item pairs) would be very inefficient in terms of storage since most entries would be zero (sparse interactions). Therefore, we will save the interaction matrix in a sparse format where we only store the non-zero interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-Tower model\n",
    "Interactions for the two-tower model are simply different data samples. This means that if a user was shown an article multiple times, each impression will be a separate data sample. The label will be 1 if the user clicked on the article, 0 if the user was shown the article but did not click on it and there will be no data sample for articles that were never shown to the user."
